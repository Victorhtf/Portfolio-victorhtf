        <p>It's good to see you there! I'm Victor Formisano, a 23-year-old Web Software Engineer based in Brazil. I have experience working with technologies like Node.js, Next.js, React.js, SASS, MySQL, Git, and Django. I have a degree in Business and Administration, which provides me with experience in team management, business administration, and business rules.</p>
        <p>I started my career as a developer in January 2022 when I was hired to work in inside sales at Dryve, a company with an annual revenue of over 70 million dollars. I identified and improved processes using programming. After demonstrating a strong commitment and hard work, I was promoted to Technical Lead in Customer Acquisition department with the goal of reducing customer acquisition costs. I had the opportunity to manage a team of 3 people and developed an API that reduced lead generation costs by 20% and optimized processes to increase productivity.</p>
        <p>Later on, I worked as a systems developer and created a website where I reached 50,000 monthly impressions with GoogleAds. These experiences were incredible as I worked with various technologies such as Django, PowerBI, FastAPI, and R, expanding my knowledge in different development areas. Since December 2023, I have been determined and focused on enhancing my web skills (React, Next, SASS, RESTful API and others) and securing a position in the field.</p>
        <p>I am a design enthusiast passionate about learning new technologies. I have been developing personal low-code projects since 2018. I love my family and dream of living abroad. Additionally, I enjoy playing video games and appreciate good design. I am actively seeking opportunities to contribute to innovative projects.</p>
